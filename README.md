# UGI Gaming

This is a prototype hybrid mobile application for the website http://ugigaming.com/new, that is still in development.

It currently uses Ionic 2, Angular 2, Typescript, SCSS, and Cordova as a wrapper to deploy to both iOS and Android devices.

If you want to see screenshots of the app in this repo, add a comment, and I can make it happen.
